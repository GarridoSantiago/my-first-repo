## My last dream

I don't really remember that clear but i dream about heroes, citys and dragons.
But actualy, not in a mediabal world, it was in the actual era. The city was incredible amazing clasic buldings an a lot of lights in the night.

One of the best parts was that my dream has a soundtrack jajaja. [Nothing else mathers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAGnKpE4NCI"CLICK TO HEAR"), Metallica was the song FCKING MAZING!!
